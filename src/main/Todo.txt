Todo:
	- Create a default file location for the storage of files
	- Reduce amount of static variables
	- Add a randomizer so Cyrus gives different error messages
	- Finish createkeybind command 
		- This command was made for fun, doesn't have an intended use at the moment
	- Update how command, add more logic
	- Launch math mode/ calculator without static variables/objects
	- Move outputHelpMessage method from command.java to AI.java
	- Add more complex math to Calculator.java
	- Add openCL support
		- This may prove to be a little challenging
	- Update seperateLines method in chatManager.java
