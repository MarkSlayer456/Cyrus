Cyrus is a program designed to help with daily tasks, at the moment the program is very bare bones. Cyrus isn't able to help with much right now. Basic commands have been made not that any of them are all that useful most just return useless information.

Cyrus is planned to have a calculator built in that can be accessed by typing math or calc. This calculator will just be a basic calculator at first, but funcationality will continued to be added to it. Eventually graphing, and calculus operations will be added.

Cyrus is also planned to have a schedule functionality. This will allow you to create events that will be emailed to you, by Cyrus, so you don't forget to do the things you have planned.
