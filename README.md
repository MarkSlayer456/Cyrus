Current Version: Cyrus 1.2.2

Team:
    - Mark (Lead Programmer)

Info:
Cyrus is a program designed to help with daily tasks, at the moment the 
program is very bare bones. Cyrus isn't able to help with much right now. 
Basic commands have been made not that any of them are all that useful 
most just return useless information.

Cyrus is planned to have a calculator built in that can be accessed by 
typing math or calc. This calculator will just be a basic calculator at 
irst, but funcationality will continued to be added to it. Eventually 
graphing, and calculus operations will be added.

Cyrus is also planned to have a schedule functionality. This will allow 
you to create events that will be emailed to you, by Cyrus, so you don't 
forget to do the things you have planned.
