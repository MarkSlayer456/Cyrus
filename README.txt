# Cyrus
This program is designed to have an intelligent AI, named Cyrus, help you with daily tasks

Please note: I am a college student, I taught myself how to code java, please do not except the code to be the best possible solution to the problem. If you think there is a better way to do something please let me know!


Here is a roadmap of what I will be trying to accomplish for each month:
NOTE: If I don't complete something on the designated month then it will be moved to top priority in the next month


RoadMap
Starting Date: 10/1/18
Month 1:
  - Setup very basic UI
  - Create interpreter algorithm (interprets user inputs)
      - Make it so Cyrus can respond to greetings
          - "hello", "hi", "good morning" etc.
  - Add a text box so user can ask cyrus things  
Month 2:
  - Update interpreter
      - Make it so Cyrus can respond to some questions
          - "what"
  - Create a file interpreter algorithm
  - Add a toggle button (a button on the keyboard) to make cyrus appear or go away
Month 3:
  - Update interpreter
      - Make it so Cyrus can respond to more questions
          - "how" and "why"
  - Add default answers to commonly asked questions 
    - Create commonquestions.cy to store commonly asked questions
Month 4:
  - Update interpreter
      - Make it so Cyrus can repsond to more questions
          - "which", "when", "who"
  - Add default jokes for Cyrus to tell
    - Add commands: joke, tell joke
    - Create jokes.cy to store jokes
Month 5:
  - Fix bugs
Month 6:
  - Update interpreter
    - Make it so Cyrus checks for command words
    - Create commands.cy to store commands
  - Add commands
    - time (tells time)
  - Update UI
    - Add a text color option
    - Add a background color option
    - Change default appearence
Month 7:
  - Add more default questions and jokes for Cyrus to answer/tell
    - update jokes.cy and commonquestions.cy
  - Create Cyrus logo/symbol
Month 8:
  - Add a reading algorithm (will allow Cyrus to read to you if I ever add a voice for him)
  - Add a way so Cyrus can tell you the weather (not sure if this is possible)
    - Add option to always show the weather on the screen
    - Add command: weather
Month 9:
  - Create encryption algorithm (make it so cyrus can encrypt files so you can't view them without cyrus)
    - .txt --> .cye
    - Add command: encrypt <filename> <password> 
      - if the <password> parameter is left blank then there will not be a password
  - Create file mask algorithm (this is so people can't mess with the .txt files created for cyrus to read for frequently asked quesitons)
    -.txt --> .cy
Month 10:
  - Makeup month
Month 11:
  - Makeup month 2 (might change this)
Month 12:
